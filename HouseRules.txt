Does zombie get compensation for losing?

Every group I've played with says no.  Zombie doesn't get a punishment for losing (other than a lost encounter card), so they don't get compensation.
Otherwise they could drain hands by playing negotiates while sending 4 ships.

a) how would they get so many negotiate cards
b) isn't that kind of the point of zombie?
