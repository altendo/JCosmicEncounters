For this project we will use standard Java coding standards
(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html). We aren't going
to be coding standard nazis, so they aren't strictly enforceable, but effort
should be made to stick to it.

The following is a gist of the standard:

* Only initialize one variable per line.
* There should be a space between a control structure and its associated
  parentheses. (ie, if (true), not if(true)).
* Braces are opened on the same line as the class, method, or control structure,
  and closed on a new line. Example:

  class MyClass {

  }

  if (true) {

  }
* ALWAYS use braces with if.
* For if and try/catch, use the following system:

  if (bool1) {

  } else if (bool2) {

  } else {

  }

  try {

  } catch (Exception e) {

  }
* 80 characters per line.

Additional considerations:
* 4 spaces for indentation. NO TABS. Nick will kill over this so don't do it.
* No trailing whitespace, this will piss off Morgan.
